# CyberCoach_Blazor

A webapp written in blazor that creates workout plans and meal plans based on user inputs.
The user is prompted to a startup wizard where they fill in their information such as weight, goal and other preferences.
As of now the user data is transient for test purposes.

Main goal is to have individual login and a database with all the inputs saved from earlier. 
User can then login to see their plans and change preferences if wanted.
